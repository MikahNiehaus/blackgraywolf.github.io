I’ve recently started flat iron. I’m having trouble figuring everything out and the entire set up is pretty new to me. I was having trouble figuring out how to watch the meetings and getting in contact with student services to help me. I focused a lot on my curriculum and getting projects done. I got almost half of them done in three days. I just rather cram the first week and then have the second week knowing that I’m good for the 1st mile. I really like how the curriculum is set up it is very similar to how I like to learn. It just gives you the information and if you don’t get it right off the bat you can very easily get in contact with someone within minutes to help you out and they do a really good job explaining everything and making sure that you understand what’s happening. I’m really glad that I have started flat iron.
