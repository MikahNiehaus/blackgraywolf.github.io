Iâ€™ve recently started flat iron. I'm ready to work hard and get things done. I was told that starting the "first mile" would be the hardest part so I crammed hard. I worked over 12 hours a day and got half of the "first mile" done in the first 3 days. I utilized everything that flat iron had to offer to get my work done quickly and efficiently. With most of the "first mile" done I have no worries of falling behind and that was worth the extra work put during the start.
