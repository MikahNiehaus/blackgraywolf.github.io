Learning Sinatra was the most difficult thing so far the week break definitely helped because I was far behind my work and pulling crazy work hours. The videos and labs helped a lot I watch them all and went to the get hub code afterwards. Getting a hold with the people at flat iron and share a screening wow I coded also helped immensely. I think this was the hardest for me because I never really did anything like this before. I knew how to use HTML and code but I never did something as advanced as Sinatra. I now have a much better understanding of Sinatra and though I still need to go back through my notes over and over again to look things up I understand the basic concept and use that knowledge to create my Sinatra project which was a offshoot of reddit called reddthat. I started off with having no idea how websites and especially password security worked and now I have a pretty good understanding of it.
