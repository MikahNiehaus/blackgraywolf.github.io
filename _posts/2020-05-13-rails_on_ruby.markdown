Ruby on rails was very similar to Sinatra. I utilized what I learned in Sinatra to help me in my rails application. I created a vote application that will allow the user to vote and debate on various topics. It Includes has_many, belongs_to, and has_many :through relationships. It includes class level ActiveRecord chainable scope method and Provides standard user authentication. The authentication system allows login from Github using omniauth or the staded way of signing up. It uses nested resources with the appropriate RESTful URLs and correctly displays validation errors.
