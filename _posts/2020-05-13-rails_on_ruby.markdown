Ruby on rails was very similar to Sinatra. I thought it was A good idea that we learn Sinatra first because rails did a lot of the code for you. Especially in the view I really like the form_for function. Rails did a little bit too much for you and it sort of made it a little bit hard to understand but since I started out with Sinatra I could understand it. The hardest part of rails was using omniauth. But I was really glad once I got it to work because before I started flatiron I never imagined being able to do that. Before I started bladder and I didnâ€™t even understand how password security worked.
