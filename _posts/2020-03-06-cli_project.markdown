The CLI project was quite difficult. I spent most of the time trying to figure out how to scrape properly. The biggest problem I had was the code on the website I was using was not set up how I would like it. They would have two things name the same thing so when I try to write down the text of just one thing I would have multiple lines of text that I did not want. The tax code also have a lot of new lines that I did not want. Overall I spent about 80% of the time learning how to write the code I need and 30% actually writing the code. That is not a bad thing because I learned a lot doing the project. The project I made is a Pokémon game that scrapes all Pokémon names and then scrapes the description behind them. You can catch new Pokémon at random as well as look up any Pokémon. spent a lot of time on my project and I am very proud on the results of my hard work.
