My project is called CC and it is used for saving Close-Captions from Youtube and quicky finding forgotten parts. This is done by easley adding the closed captions of YouTube videos into my program and then it will be edited into a more readable form and opened in word so you can easily find specific words in the context that it was said in. My application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend with a Rails API backend. It handles client and server interactions asynchronously (AJAX) and use JSON as the communication format. It uses Object Oriented JavaScript with a Rails backend that includes a resource with has-many relationship. It has AJAX calls, CRUD, uses fetch with HTTP verb, and Rails API uses RESTful conventions.
