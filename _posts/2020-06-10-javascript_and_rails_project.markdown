The JavaScript and realist project was the hardest project yet. Fetch specifically was very difficult to understand. My project was really simple and putting it together was very hard but I see how it could scale up very easily by reusing a lot of the same code. The hardest part was using three different languages and communicating with all of them. I Felt like I was sort of just hard JavaScript and then jumped right into using ruby SQL and JavaScript altogether without much intro but I ended up getting the hang of it.
